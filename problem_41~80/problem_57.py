# Problem_57
# Square root convergents
# It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as
# an infinite continued fraction.
#
# âˆš 2 = 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + ... ))) = 1.414213...
#
# By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:
#
# 1 + 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5
# 1 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 7/5 = 1.4
# 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2)) = 17/12 = 1.41666...
# 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2))) = 41/29 = 1.41379...
#
# The next three expansions are 99/70, 239/169, and 577/408, but the eighth expansion,
# 1393/985, is the first example where the number of digits in the numerator
# exceeds the number of digits in the denominator.
#
# In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator
# with more digits than denominator?
